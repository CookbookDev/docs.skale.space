## The Go Live Process

If you are preparing to go live on to SKALE Mainnet, then
the following steps can help expedite the process.

### Showcase your Work

First, start by heading over to the SKALE Network Discord channel.
Once there, show of your project in the #showcase-your-work channel.
This will allow members of the SKALE Community to give feedback and enable
you to start showcasing your game.

### Check your Smart Contracts

The SKALE Network is known by developers and users alike for its unique zero gas fee model.
This core difference on SKALE Chains may cause a breaking change in your smart contract.

:::danger
If you are attempting to use *msg.value* to capture value in the form a token, this will not work on SKALE.
