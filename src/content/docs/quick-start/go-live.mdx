## The Go Live Process

If you are preparing to go live on to SKALE Mainnet, then
the following steps can help expedite the process.

Showcase your Work

First, start by heading over to the SKALE Network Discord channel.
Once there, show of your project in the #showcase-your-work channel.
This will allow members of the SKALE Community to give feedback and enable
