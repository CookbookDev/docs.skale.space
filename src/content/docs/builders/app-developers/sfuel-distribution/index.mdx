description: Distribution of the SKALE Native Gas Token

SKALE Network has an unique economic model by having a gas token, sFUEL, with no economic value. This means that all SKALE chains require the gas token to perform transactions, however it can't be purchased on a CEX or DEX due to its valueless nature. Instead, the gas token needs to be distributed to the user.

This model offers numerous advantages while specifically unleashing two primary ones without sacrificing security or decentralization:
- Large cost reductions to developers and users;
- Possibility to provide a smooth and frictionless experience to the end user;

In order to achieve the experience described above is important to all SKALE dApps implement a distribution mechanism that suits better their users and application flow.

The following are the most common distribution options found within the SKALE Ecosystem.

| Distribution Type | Security | Speed | Requirements | Distribution Location |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| [API](/builders/app-developers/sfuel-distribution/api-distribution) | centralized | 3s - 4s | server | backend |
| [Proof-of-Work](/builders/app-developers/sfuel-distribution/pow-distribution) | decentralized | 5s - 10s | none | smart contract |
| [Smart Contract](/builders/app-developers/sfuel-distribution/contract-distribution) | decentralized | 3s - 4s | server | smart contract |
