Here’s an overview of what Eidolon SDK handles:

- **Blockchain Interaction**: Eidolon.Unity allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain effortlessly. With just a few lines of code, you can perform various operations, such as sending transactions, reading contract data, and managing accounts.

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect to popular browser wallets like MetaMask, TrustWallet, and Enkrypt. Eidolon.Unity seamlessly integrates with these wallets, providing your users with a familiar and secure way to manage their assets.

- **ERC Standards Support**: Eidolon.Unity supports Ethereum’s ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 token standards, enabling you to work with a wide range of blockchain assets and NFTs.

- **WebGL Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with Unity WebGL, Eidolon.Unity ensures that your games can be easily deployed to the web, allowing players to experience your blockchain-powered creations directly in their browsers.

- **Native Gas distribution**: Due to the zero gas fees of SKALE, in order to allow users performing transactions the dApps need to implement a gas token distribution or sFUEL distribution. Eidolon already takes care of that for the developers.

{/*## Implementation Example

The Eidolon SDK aims to make the blockchain development side of things as simple and quick as possible.

The simplicity explained above can be seen, for example, in the contracts deployment section of the Eidolon SDK.
The image bellow exemplifies how quickly a ERC-20 token can be deployed.
