<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Unity">

**Package Install**
- Get the package on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/decentralization/infrastructure/emergence-sdk-252187)

**Contract Call Example**
```c#
public class NFTMint : MonoBehaviour
{

    public DeployedSmartContract deployedSmart;

    // Public string array that is used as input data for the smart contract method
    private string[] body = new string[] { "0x...SomeAddress" };
    // Public string that is used as input data for the smart contract method
    private string value = "0";

    private IContractService ContractService => contractService ??= EmergenceServices.GetService<IContractService>();
    private IContractService contractService;


    private void Awake()
    {
     //   contractService = EmergenceServices.GetService<IContractService>();
    }

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        WriteMethod();
    }


    // This method is called once the contract is loaded
    private void WriteMethod()
    {
        // Creates a ContractInfo object with the smart contract address, method name, network name, and default node URL
        var contractInfo = new ContractInfo(deployedSmart, "safeMint");
        ContractService.WriteMethod(contractInfo, "", "100000", value, body, OnWriteSuccess, EmergenceLogger.LogError);
    }

    private void OnWriteSuccess(BaseResponse<string> response)
    {
        // Logs the response to the console
        Debug.Log($"{response}");
    }
}
```
