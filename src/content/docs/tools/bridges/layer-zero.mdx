    introParagraph="LayerZero is an interoperability protocol designed to link blockchains, enabling developers to create fluid omnichain applications, tokens, and experiences. Utilizing immutable on-chain endpoints, a customizable Security Stack, and an open set of Executors, the protocol facilitates the transfer of censorship-resistant messages across chains."

## Implementation Example

The following example shows how to create and bridge an ERC-20 token between SKALE Europa testnet and Mumbai Testnet.

For more information check the [github repository](https://github.com/TheGreatAxios/skale-layerzero-examples/tree/main) created by the SKALE team.

**Run the command**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheGreatAxios/skale-layerzero-examples.git && cd skale-layerzero-examples/oft-example
```

**Package Install**
```sh
pnpm install
```

**Rename .env.example -> .env**
**Choose your preferred means of setting up your deployer wallet/account**
```sh
MNEMONIC="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
or...
PRIVATE_KEY="0xabc...def"
```

**To deploy you contracts run**

:::tip[Note]
Please deploy the contract in the chains you want to enable bridging 
:::
```sh
npx hardhat lz:deploy
```

With the ERC-20 contracts deployed on the desired chains we can enable bridging those asserts.

This is a two step process. The created examples are under the `scripts` folder and it shows the bridging tokens between two testnet chains Mumbai Testnet and SKALE Europa Testnet. 

Once you've finished configuring your OFT, you can open the messaging channel and connect your OFT deployment to different chains by calling setPeer. 

1. **Set Peer**

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Set Peer on Europa">
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/setPeer.ts --network europa
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Set Peer on Mumbai">
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/setPeer.ts --network mumbai
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. **Bridge**

After seting the peers you can now procced you bridging the tokens.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Bridge tokens from Europa to Mumbai">
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/bridge.ts --network europa
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Bridge tokens from Mumbai to Europa">
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/bridge.ts --network mumbai
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</ToolLayout>
