SKALE Network has an unique economic model by having a gas token, sFUEL, with no economic value. This means that all SKALE chains require the gas token to perform transactions, however this token can't be purchased on a CEX or DEX due to its valueless nature.

This model has several benefits but unlocks two main ones without compromising security of decentralization:
- Large cost reductions to developers and users;
- Possibility to provide a smooth and frictionless experience to the end user;

Since the sFUEL can't be purchased, it requires it to be distributed to the end user. 
In order to achieve the experience described above is important to all SKALE dApps implement a distribution mechanism that suits better their users and application flow.

The following are the two most common distribution options found within the SKALE Ecosystem.
