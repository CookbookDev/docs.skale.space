Distribution through a smart contract is a good way to implement the distribution as well as other requirements/logic in more secure and decentralized manner.

It's important to take in consideration that the sFUEL distribution should be handle carefully. This means sFUEL should be given in small amounts `(suggested amount: 0.00001 sFUEL)` and it's crucial to make sure no unauthorized address can drain all sFUEL given to the distribution contract.

### Implementation Example

```solidity 
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract sFUEL_Distribution is AccessControl{

    bytes32 public constant MANAGER_ROLE = keccak256("MANAGER_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant WHITELIST_ROLE = keccak256("WHITELIST_ROLE");

    uint256 public amount = 0.00001 ether;

    event sFUELDistributed(address indexed to, uint256 indexed amount);
    event AmountUpdated(uint256 indexed originalAmount, uint256 indexed newAmount, address indexed signer);


    constructor(){
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(MANAGER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    /**
     * @dev function to receive Ether. msg.data must be empty
     */
    receive() external payable {}
    
    /**
     * @dev fallback function is called when msg.data is not empty
     */
    fallback() external payable {}

    /**
        Get contract balance
     */
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    /**
        Update amount to distribute to user
     */
    function updateAmount(uint256 _newAmount) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
        require(_newAmount > 0, "sFUEL_Distribution: Invalid Amount");
        uint256 originalAmount = amount;
        amount = _newAmount;
        emit AmountUpdated(originalAmount, amount, msg.sender);
    }

    /**
        Manager accounts can request sFUEL distribution to users
     */
    function distribute(address to) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
        require(!hasRole(WHITELIST_ROLE, to), "AlreadyWhitelisted");
        require(getBalance() >= amount, "ContractOutOfSFuel");
        require(to.balance < 0.000005 ether, "address rceiver has enough sFUEL");

        payable(to).transfer(amount);

        emit sFUELDistributed(to,amount);
    }
}
```
