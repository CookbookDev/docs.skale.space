title: SKALE Chain Fuel
description: SKALE's Native Gas Token sFUEL
---

SKALE Chains enable dApps and their users to run scalable, zero-gas cost transactions using SKALE Chains'
native token SKALE Fuel (sFUEL). sFUEL allows developers to scale their dApp not only for speed but also
to scale economically and provides users with an optimal user experience.

SKALE Chains require users to have sFUEL or use _Proof-of-Work_ to conduct transactions with the former being
far more common and compatible with multi-chain applications. sFUEL is a zero-cost gas token with no economic
value and provides a way for dApps and users to access SKALE Chains and protects against DDoS attacks.
