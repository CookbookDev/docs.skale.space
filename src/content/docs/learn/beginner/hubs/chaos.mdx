The Chaos Testnet, while not a true hub, is an important location in the SKALE Ecosystem.
With SKALE Chains being permissioned by default, you must be given access to deploy by the SKALE Chain Owner
or Permission manager on **EVERY** SKALE Chain, except for Chaos.

To get started building on SKALE, you can head over to the [sFUEL Station](https://sfuel.dirtroad.dev/staging/chaos),
grab some some sFUEL, and start building on the [Chaos Testnet](https://testnet.portal.skale.space/chains/chaos) in just a few minutes.
